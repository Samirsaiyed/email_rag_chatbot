Final terms represent a win-win arrangement that secures reliable supply while maintaining acceptable pricing. Key Negotiation Points: Volume Commitment: Initial request was 75,000 MMBtuday. Settled at 50,000 MMBtuday with option to increase to 65,000 after 12 months based on performance. Pricing Structure: Axia wanted fixed pricing. We pushed for index-based pricing. Final agreement: NYMEX  0.15MMBtu basis differential, which is favorable given current market conditions. Contract Duration: Compromised on 36 months (their ask: 60 months, our initial offer: 24 months). This provides adequate stability while maintaining flexibility. Credit Terms: Agreed to 500,000 security deposit (down from their initial ask of 1M). Credit limit approved at 5M based on risk analysis. Delivery Points: Secured Houston Ship Channel as primary delivery point, which aligns with our distribution infrastructure. Next Steps: - Legal review: February 13-14 - Executive approval: February 15 - Contract execution: February 20 - First delivery: March 1"

Retail Rate Freeze: AB 1890 prevents utilities from passing costs to consumers, creating massive losses for PGE and SCE. Credit Exposure: Our receivables have grown to 185M. Bankruptcy risk is material and increasing daily. State Intervention: State purchasing power on behalf of utilities. Long-term solution unclear. Political pressure for rate increases vs. public backlash. Our Strategy: 1. Minimize new California exposure 2. Collect receivables aggressively 3. Prepare for potential bankruptcy filing 4. Monitor legislative developments Outlook: Situation remains fluid. Bankruptcy filing by PGE within 60-90 days is probable unless state provides financial support."

Summer peak demand in Southwest drives high spot prices 2. Our generation portfolio benefits from peak pricing 3.
